Multi-Account Discord Nitro sniper and Giveaway joiner written in Go 1.15.6.

I have to give <a href="https://github.com/Vedza">@Vedza</a> some credit as I used his nitro sniper as a base.  
Multi-Account threading along with code-caching for dupe protection and a few other nick-nacks are courtesy of me.

If you need any help or have any suggestions you can chekout my main profile for contact details.

### Features 
* Supports multiple accounts (optional).
* Redeems all codes on the main account.
* Uses Fast HTTP package for Go (faster than Python requests).
* Cooldown for # hour(s) after redeeming # nitro code(s).
* Optional Nitro Giveway joiner.
* DM host with custom DM message if giveaway won.
* Removes some gift-code obfuscation.
* Fake/duplicate code detection to avoid being banned.
* Webhook support with extended features like 'ping user' and 'report failed codes/giveaway entries'.
* Webhook returns color based on success or failure (green/red)
* Cross-platform binaries for Linux and Windows.
